PowerShell scripts I use for setting up and configuring my Windows machine(s)

Powered by:

- chocolatey to automate most installations
- oh-my-posh and posh-git for configuring my PowerShell
- PowerShell and Windows Registry for uninstalling and configuring other stuff

Before running these scripts the PowerShell script execution policy needs to be changed:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```
